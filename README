Tests
Tests are now included in the boiler plate.  This is an intial brain-dump.  The structure will likely change.

To create and run tests:

1) Create your spec file in 'tests/js/specs/' from 'specStub'.
2) Include the module to be tested and write the appropriate tests in the "test" method of the returned object
3) Include the test module in the 'spec-runner.js' file
4) Run the test method of the test module
5) See results in /tests/index.html

Example test is included testing the "main-view" module that displays "App Initialized!".
